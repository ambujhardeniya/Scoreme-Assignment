DevOps Engineer Assignment: Constructing a Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline


To create a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for your project, you need to follow the steps outlined in the assignment. Here's a high-level overview of how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Jenkins Setup
1. **Install Jenkins**:
   - You can install Jenkins on a virtual machine or use a cloud-based service like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
   - Follow the [official Jenkins installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) for your preferred platform.
### Step 1: Install Jenkins

#### On a Virtual Machine (Linux)

1. **Update your system:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

2. **Install Java (Jenkins requires Java):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    ```

3. **Add the Jenkins repository and key:**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
      /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
    echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
      /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    ```

4. **Install Jenkins:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install jenkins
    ```

5. **Start Jenkins:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start jenkins
    sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    ```

6. **Access Jenkins:**
    Open a web browser and go to `http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080`. Follow the instructions to unlock Jenkins using the initial admin password found in `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.

#### On a Cloud-Based Service

You can use services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to set up Jenkins. These platforms often provide pre-configured Jenkins instances that you can deploy with a few clicks.


2. **Configure Jenkins**:
   - Install necessary plugins: Git, GitHub, SonarQube, JaCoCo, OWASP Dependency-Check, and any other required plugins.
   - Configure Jenkins with your Git repository.
### Step 1: Configure Jenkins

1. **Install Necessary Plugins:**
    - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins`.
    - Install the following plugins:
        - Git Plugin
        - GitHub Integration Plugin (if using GitHub)
        - Any other SCM tools you plan to use

2. **Configure Global Tool Configuration:**
    - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Global Tool Configuration`.
    - Configure Git by specifying the path to the Git executable.


### Step 2: Source Code Management
- Ensure your code is hosted on a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- Configure Jenkins to pull code from your repository.

### Step 3: Pipeline Creation
- Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the root of your repository to define the pipeline stages.
      
### Step 3: Create a Jenkins Pipeline

3. **Create a new Jenkins job:**
    - Go to `New Item` > `Pipeline`.
    - Configure the pipeline to use the Jenkinsfile from your repository.

1. **Create a Jenkinsfile in your repository:**


   


### Step 4: Code Quality Checks
- Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis.
- Configure the pipeline to break if the code quality gates are not met.

### Step 5: Code Coverage
- Integrate a code coverage tool like JaCoCo for Java applications or another relevant tool based on your programming language.
- Publish the code coverage report in Jenkins.

### Step 6: Cyclomatic Complexity
- Integrate a tool like Lizard to calculate and report cyclomatic complexity.

### Step 7: Security Vulnerability Scan
- Integrate OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for known security vulnerabilities.

### Step 8: Notifications
- Configure Jenkins to send notifications via email or Slack on build success or failure.

### Step 9: Documentation
- Document the pipeline steps, tools integrated, and any configurations needed for the setup.
- Include troubleshooting steps for common issues.

### Example `Jenkinsfile`
Here's an example `Jenkinsfile` to get you started:
To set up Jenkins, follow these steps:






This setup will get you started with Jenkins, configured to use Git and other SCM tools.
